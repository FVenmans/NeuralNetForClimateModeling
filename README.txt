This is code to estimate the model a simple climate Integrated Assessment Model with Deep Neural Nets. As an example, I use a stochastic version of the model by Dietz & Venmans published in JEEM 2018 "Cumulative carbon emissions and economic policy: in search of general principles". The main aim of this code is pedagogical, to show the method in it's simplest setting. The setup is very close to Simon Scheidegger’s code for a simple ABC model (and he is clearly pioneering this area, i’m just extending the application). 
This is work in progress, comments are very welcome.
